# Orbital Escape - Development Plan

## Game Overview
A 3D web-based game where players pilot a spaceship through an asteroid field while collecting energy orbs. Built using Three.js for 3D rendering.

## Technical Stack
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Three.js for 3D graphics
- Node.js & npm for development
- VS Code with Live Server
